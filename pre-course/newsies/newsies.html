    <p>WASHINGTON -  In a stunning and historic upset, Donald J. Trump, 
      the businessman and reality television star, has been elected the 
      45th President of the United States. Trump’s victory over former 
      Secretary of State Hillary Clinton marks one of the most shocking 
      political turnarounds in modern American history.
    </p>
    <p>
    Trump, who ran on a platform of radical change and a promise to "Make 
    America Great Again," secured key victories in battleground states, 
    including Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, ultimately amassing more 
    than the required 270 Electoral College votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his election night headquarters in New York City, Trump 
      addressed an exuberant crowd of supporters just after 3 a.m. 
      “This is not a campaign, this is a movement,” Trump declared. 
      “I will be President for all Americans, and this is so important 
      to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Trump's campaign, characterized by its unorthodox strategies and 
      controversial rhetoric, tapped into a deep well of voter 
      frustration with the political establishment. His promises to 
      renegotiate trade deals, build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico 
      border, and repeal the Affordable Care Act resonated with millions 
      of Americans who felt left behind by the economic recovery and 
      disillusioned by Washington politics.
